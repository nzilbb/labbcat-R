[LaBB-CAT](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz) is a browser-based linguistic annotation store that stores audio or video recordings, 
text transcripts, and other annotations. The *nzilbb.labbcat* R package provides access to linguistic data stored in LaBB-CAT 
servers, allowing tokens and their annotations to be identified and extracted, along with media data, and acoustic measurements.

This worked example illustrates how to:

1. identify a set of phone tokens in a specific context, 
2. extract annotation labels for the word tokens and their speakers,
2. download audio files for all tokens,
3. execute a custom R script to extract acoustic measurements from the audio files.

## Example: the effects of morphology and demographics on the acoustic properties of /s/ 

In particular, we might be interested in whether the /s/ in a *mis* in a prefixed word like *mistimes* is pronounced differently from the *mis* in an unprefixed word like *mistakes*, and whether demographics of the speaker make any difference.

First the *nzilbb.labbcat* package must be loaded, and the LaBB-CAT corpus is specified:

```{r nzilbb.labbcat, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(nzilbb.labbcat)
labbcat.url <- Sys.getenv('TEST_READ_LABBCAT_URL') # load details from .Renviron file
credentialError <- labbcatCredentials(
  labbcat.url, Sys.getenv('TEST_READ_LABBCAT_USERNAME'), Sys.getenv('TEST_READ_LABBCAT_PASSWORD'))
```

Now we search our LaBB-CAT corpus for force-aligned words with orthography that starts "dis" or "mis".

```{r searches, warning=FALSE}
matches <- getMatches(labbcat.url, list(orthography = "[dm]is.+"), anchor.confidence.min = 50)

# show the first few matches
head(matches)[, c("Transcript", "Target.word", "Target.word.start")]
```

In order to be able to analyse the /s/ segments, we need it's start and end time, so we can extract a matching sound sample. We identify the first three *segment* annotations of each token, the last of which will be the /s/ segment we're interested in.

```{r segments}
matches <- matches |> appendOffsets("segment", annotations.per.layer=3)

# show the first few alignments
head(matches)[, c(
  "Text", "segment.3", "segment.3.start", "segment.3.end")]
```

We want to check whether the acoustic properties of /s/ vary depending on whether it's in a morphological prefix or not, so we need the morphological parses of each word token. We also extract some demographic information about the speakers.

```{r morphology-and-demographics}
matches <- matches |> appendLabels(
  c("morphology", "participant_age_category", "participant_gender"))

# show the first few annotations
head(matches)[, c(
  "Text", "morphology", "participant_age_category", "participant_gender")]
```

We want to perform acoustic analysis, so we need the wav sample for each match, which can be extracted from LaBB-CAT as as a mono 22kHz files using `getSoundFragments`.

```{r process.row, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# define subdirectory to save the files in
subdir <- "s-tokens"

# get segment sound files from LaBB-CAT
wav.files <- getSoundFragments(
  labbcat.url, matches$Transcript, matches$segment.3.start, matches$segment.3.end, 22050, 
  path=subdir)

# show the first few file names
head(wav.files)
```

Now that we have tokens of /s/, we want to use R to perform acoustic analysis of the sound of each token, and save the resulting acoustic measurements in the data frame with the results.

By way of example, [Koenig *et al.* (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0038)) propose an 8-factor multitaper spectrum calculated over 25 ms portions of the segment, i.e. 8 independent estimates of the spectrum in a single time window are calculated and averaged. We will use a custom R script (adapted from a script written by Patrick Reidy, who has kindly given permission for its use in this example) to provide a function called `process.wav` which takes a .wav file for a given token and returns the Koenig *et al.* (2013) measures.

This function is defined in [hayhawkins-multitaper.R](https://github.com/nzilbb/labbcat-R/blob/master/vignettes/examples/hayhawkins-multitaper.R), which must be loaded:

```{r hayhawkins-multitaper, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE}
source('hayhawkins-multitaper.R')
```

The `process.wav` function processes a single sound file, so we `apply` it to all our /s/ tokens, and add the resulting acoustic measures to our *matches* data frame.

```{r data.table, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(data.table) # (we need this package in order to use rbindlist below)
```
```{r apply-wav.files, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
s.measures.lists <- lapply(wav.files, process.wav)

# combine the acoustic measures with the matches
matches <- cbind(matches, as.data.frame(rbindlist(s.measures.lists)))
```

Now that the sound files we downloaded have been processed, we don't need them any more, so we tidily delete them to save disk space.

```{r tidy-up, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results = 'hide', warning=FALSE}
unlink(subdir, recursive = TRUE)
```

Our `process.wav` function produces 12 acoustic measures, three of which are printed below by way of example:

- *freqM* - peak frequency in the 'medium' range (3kHz to 7kHz)
- *freqH* - peak frequency in the 'high' range (7kHz to the Nyquist frequency)
- *CoG* - the centre of gravity of the whole spectrum

```{r example-measures, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
head(matches)[, c("Number", "Text", "segment.3.start", "freqM", "freqH", "CoG")]
```

The dataset now includes acoustic measurements allowing study the acoustic properties of /s/, in relation to morphology and speaker demographics:

* tokens of /s/ in dis/mis prefixed words,
* demographic information about the speaker,
* the morphological parse of the word,
* various acoustic measures computed from the audio using an R script
